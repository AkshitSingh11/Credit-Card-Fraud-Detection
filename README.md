This dataset has been taken from kaggle website
      
      [](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 271 frauds out of 141682 transactions. 
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.18% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'.
Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. 
The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. 
Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Since the dataset is unbalanced, we have done under sampling the dataset and have used Logistic Regression as well as Random Forest Classifier on the balanced dataset.

**We got AUC of Random Forest Classifier equal to 0.9444 and AUC of Logistic Regression equal to 0.9436.**
